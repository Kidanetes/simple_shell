# simple_shell
we work in team of two for the simple shell project
steps to a shell
step1 :- prompt("$ ")
step2 :- accept command from the user
step3 :- the shell reads the command and separates it into the command name and arguments
step4 :- the shell identifies if it is builtin or excutable, if it is builtin, it will run its own builtin function, otherwise it will excute the excutable command.
finally, it displays the output or the error
prompt("$ "), unless exit is prompted, or Ctlr+d is pressed. and repeat steps from 2 to 8.
