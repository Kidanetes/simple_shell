# simple_shell
we work in team of two for the simple shell project
steps to a shell
1. step1 :- prompt("$ ")
2. step2 :- accept command from the user
3. step3 :- the shell reads the command and separates it into the command name and arguments
4. step4 :- the shell identifies if it is builtin or excutable, if it is builtin, it will run its own builtin function, otherwise it will excute the excutable command.
5. step 5 finally, it displays the output or the error
6. step 1 prompt("$ "), unless exit is prompted, or Ctlr+d is pressed.
7. Repeat from step 2 to step 8
